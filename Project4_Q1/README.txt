Before running the code, the following command must be run in Anaconda Prompt:
1. pip install keras
2. pip install tensorflow
3.conda install h5py
4.pip install Matplotlib
5. pip install numpy

For some reasons, our group has errors when running the code with new python version, therefore,
The accomplishment of this project from our group is done by using the following version:
1. Python 3.7.9
2. Keras 2.2.4
3. Tensorflow-GPU 1.13.1
4. CUDA Toolkit 10.0
5. cuDNN 7.6.1

Note1: These version requires adding 'tensorflow.' in front of keras (for example: from tensorflow.keras......import........)
Note2ï¼šIf you cannot run the code successfully with python3.8 or newer version, please change 'acc' into 'accuracy'
Note3: For the Final_evaluate section, if you get error with h5py version, please reinstall with 'pip install h5py==2.10.0' in Anaconda prompt.

We had followed the instruction from the following website to setup the python environment and run the code sucessfully:
