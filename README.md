# Project4-CNN
Convolutional Neural Network (Build model and make prediction from CIFAR-10 dataset)
Q1: Run the code and reproduce the same results as being presented for all 5 sections:
      https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-cnnfrom-scratch-for-cifar-10-photo-classification/
      
Q2: Leverage any resources you can access to leverage a method to digitize any image to 32x32x3 pixel format.
    Provide 20 samples of your own pictures that are types of (Airplane, Automobile, 
    Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck) and save all of them to the same folder. 
    Now use the same method that you just developed, write a python software to read 
    a folder containing images and convert them into files of 32x32x3-pixel format.
    
Q3 & 4: Run with your own images and confirm that you achieve the same classification similar to the section#1's prediction.

Q5: Uploaded to Github
